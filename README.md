- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cjjones007
- Iâ€™m interested in IT, Cloud Technologies, Systems Administration, and Docker.
- Iâ€™m currently transitioning from a traditional Server Admin to Systems administration and Cloud engineering, learning a slew of new technolocies.
- Iâ€™m looking to learn DevOps and build a knowledge of K8s and Docker. I'm hoping to increase my home lab with everything from traditional servers to clusters of RPI4s.
